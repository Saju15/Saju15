### Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Saju,
a Computer Science Student with a Love for Learning.

From small coding exercises to full-fledged projects, I've taken every opportunity to apply what I've learned and improve my skills.

My projects may not be the most groundbreaking, but each one represents a step in my growth and passion for coding. I'm eager to share them with you!

Feel free to explore my work and journey, and if you have any feedback or advice, I'm always open to learning and improving.

I hope you find something interesting here.
